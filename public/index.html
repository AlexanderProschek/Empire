        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of the game a question is asked and everyone must join with the code and answer the question in the form (either truthfully or not).</p>
        <p>Once everyone is done, the person who created the game will start the game and all words will get displayed two times, after which they will diappear forever.</p>
        <p>Everyone starts off as the head of their own Empire. Players will go around one by one guessing who answered the question with what answer. If they guess correctly, the guesser and their Empire will secede and join the guessers Empire. Their job now is to help the head of the Empire guess the remaining answers. The guesser can guess as often as they guess correctly.</p>
        <p>The winner of the game is the head of the last Empire.</p>
        <p style="color: gray;">Hint: Competing Empires will not want to share the words with each other, since words are only displayed once at the very beinning. Every Empire should collaborate internally to remember the answers themselves!</p>
